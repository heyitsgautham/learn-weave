Problem 1
Learning Outcome Aligned Study Support System
Context

Indian students often focus on memorization rather than learning outcomes. Most AI tutors simply summarize text without checking if the summary helps meet a specific curriculum goal.
Challenge

Design a learning companion that ingests academic PDFs and maps content directly to Blooms Taxonomy levels. It must generate assessments that test 'Application' and 'Synthesis' rather than just 'Recall', providing hints that encourage reasoning.
Evaluation Criteria

Judging criteria includes alignment accuracy with learning outcomes, the quality of 'reasoning-based' feedback, and support for vernacular contexts.
